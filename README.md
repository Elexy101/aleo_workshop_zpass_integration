Aleo ZPass is a zero-knowledge proof-based digital identity system that allows users to prove their credentials (such as nationality, date of birth, or other personal details) without revealing sensitive information. It is built on the Aleo blockchain, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving identity verification.
